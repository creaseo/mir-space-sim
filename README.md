Hello, this is a little prject that I created to practice using Linear concepts (Matrices) to implement a simulation of a propeller plane

To simulate flight dynamics the application includes buttons that control airplane (including its propeller) orientation. 

- The green arrow buttons control yaw movements (rotation about the Y-axis).
- The red arrow buttons control pitch movements (rotation about the X-axis).
- The blue arrow buttons control roll movements (rotation about the Z-axis).
- The reset button returns airplane to its default orientation (i.e., no yaw, pitch, or roll movements). 

In addition to the controls described above, the application also includes four different canvases to visualize airplane orientation.

- One canvas draws the airplane in the XZ-plane to visualize only yaw movements. 
- One canvas draws the airplane in the YZ-plane to visualize only pitch movements. 
- One canvas draws the airplane in the XY-plane to visualize only roll movements.
- One canvas draws the airplane in all three planes (XYZ) to visualize all three movements.

Lastly, the positive x-axis in red, the positive y-axis in green, and the positive z-axis in blue are also drawn in each canvas to better understand airplane orientation.
