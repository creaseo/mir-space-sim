Hello, this is a little prject that I created to practice using Linear concepts (Matrices) to implement a simulation of an Mir Space Station in space

The space station is uniformly scaled using the value in the S input box (default is 1.25).
- rotated about its z-axis to simulate gravity (default is checked).
- rotated about its x-axis using the value in the X input box (default is 0 degrees).
- rotated about its y-axis using the value in the Y input box (default is 0 degrees).
- translated along its z-axis using the slider value (the default is 0, and the range is -1 to 1).


As before, the positive XYZ axes relative to the space station are also visualized to better understand the transformation, with the positive x-axis in red, the positive y-axis in green, and the positive z-axis in blue.
